# How Much Honey Does a Beespoon Hold?

The Beespoon is a tiny copper spoon, 1/12th the size of a teaspoon, which can contain the amount of honey a single bee can make within her lifetime. We designed an accompanying plinth, on which the Beespoon is displayed. At festivals and events around the country, we have invited visitors to create origami flowers and place them on a hanging display; and then to press a button that counts how many flowers have been created, which in turn slowly dispenses honey onto the waiting Beespoon, drop by drop. 

Visitors express amazement at how little honey a single bee can make, and reflected on how much honey they used on their breakfast toast. The time spent making the origami flowers also presents a space for discussion and the telling of bee stories. By asking people to decorate their flowers with UV reactive coloured pens, there is also an opportunity to talk about how bees see, i.e. using 5 eyes and towards the UV end of the spectrum.

Over the course of the two Telling the Bees projects, the Beespoon exhibit has undergone [numerous changes and revisions](/news/2017/09/07/building-the-beespoon.html]. There are now three different kits in existence, including one designed especially for our long-time partners, the educational charity [Bee Buddies](http://www.beebuddies.org/). 

Whilst we can no longer tour the Beespoon ourselves, we do run a lending scheme in which we send a portable version, containing a full set of resources and instructions, to local beekeeping associations and educators for use at their own events.

In case you’re wondering, our beespoon holds around 25 drops of honey.
