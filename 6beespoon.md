# How Much Honey Does a Beespoon Hold?

Our beespoon is a tiny copper spoon, 1/12th the size of a teaspoon, which can contain the amount of honey a single bee can make within her lifetime. We designed an accompanying plinth, on which the beespoon is displayed. At festivals and events around the country, we have invited visitors to create origami flowers and place them on a hanging display; and then to press a button that counts how many flowers have been created, which in turn slowly dispenses honey onto the waiting beespoon, drop by drop. 

Visitors express amazement at how little honey a single bee can make, and reflected on how much honey they used on their breakfast toast. The time spent making the origami flowers also presents a space for discussion and the telling of bee stories. By asking people to decorate their flowers with UV reactive coloured pens, there is also an opportunity to talk about how bees see, i.e. using 5 eyes and towards the UV end of the spectrum.

Over the course of the two Telling the Bees projects, the Beespoon exhibit has undergone [numerous changes and revisions](. There are now three different kits in existence, including one designed especially for our long-time partners, the educational charity [Bee Buddies](http://www.beebuddies.org/). 



In the first Telling the Bees project, we gathered in and around Perth to meet lots of wonderful, generous and knowledgeable beekeepers and storytellers from the local community. Our purpose was to learn and share stories and knowledge about bees and beekeeping. Then, together, over a series of workshops, we created and developed ideas and design prototypes, using some of the old stories about bees as inspiration. Such stories ranged from the well known ‘Telling the Bees’ (where the bees would be told of deaths in their beekeeper’s family) and ‘tanging a swarm’ (making metallic and/or banging noises to supposedly attract a swarm of bees to land nearby), to the more controversial (e.g. bees instinctively hate black dogs). Our collaborative design ideas included the Ultimate Bee Experience (a multi-million pound visitor centre), a video virtual hive (with each video frame in the box revealing a different type of management practice or colony) and a sound space with digital remastering of bee sounds (where you could produce music with bee noises, as well as soundscapes of bees: the gentle humming of happy bees, evening fanning of wings, raised or angry buzzing, and queens piping).

In early October 2105 we were part of a local Fruit Festival in Perth, where we showcased some of the wonderful co-created project outputs so far, including an augmented bee suit – a hat and veil with speakers embedded inside that told you stories as you walked around the site.

In case you’re wondering, our beespoon holds around 25 drops of honey.
