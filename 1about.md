## About Telling the Bees
Telling the Bees is a 12-month AHRC connected communities follow on project that builds on outputs from an earlier Telling the Bees project. We are engaging with new audiences, bringing drama, design, storytelling and the maker (or hacker) movement together to explore playful, immersive ways to understand global environmental issues and share future visions about bees and beekeeping. Telling the Bees is a collaboration between the universities of York, Sheffield and Lancaster, and between GrowTheatre and York Explore.

### What is "Telling the Bees?"
Telling the Bees is an old tradition in England and Wales, where beekeepers (or their families) would tell their bees of important family events (like births, deaths, marriages) so that their bees would stay healthy and wouldn't swarm.

### Project Aims
Our project aims are:
1. To reconsider the concept of ‘future folklore’ about bees and beekeeping as embodied creative learning experiences by engaging with pupils in inner-city primary schools. _We consider 'future folklore' as ways to share knowledge through stories with an intention of casting forward, this might include films, artefacts, written stories, or performances)._
2. To experiment with creative ways to secure a sustainable legacy for co-produced project outputs. _For instance, we are exploring avenues for commercialising our Beespoon from the first Telling the Bees project._
3. To share and gather knowledge and stories across communities about the global significance and
challenges facing pollinators and the honey bee.
