In 2017, our project intern interviewed Julia Smith, a local beekeeper and a member of the York and District Beekeepers' Association.

As you can see in the [video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZIa8czK24 ) we talked a lot about what it means to be a beekeeper and what it involves. With the number of bees declining globally (several types of bees are on the endangered species list), beekeepers have never been more important, as their efforts contribute to saving the environment through their understanding of local landscapes and educating general public as well as looking after and supporting honey bees. This is vitally important thanks to the role of pollinators in producing a third of the worldâ€™s food supply.

Special thanks to Julia Smith for her time, and her honey is sold under the name of Yonder Honey ([@yonderhoney](https://twitter.com/yonderhoney)).
