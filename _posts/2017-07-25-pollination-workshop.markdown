We are hosting a number of free workshops inspired by pollination, to help educate the public in global environmental issues surrounding the decline of bees. 
This will be done by creating a number of hexagons filled with artwork inspired by pictures of pollen seen through a microscope. These individual hexagons will be combined into a large mural, which will be shown during out exhibition in October, and put on display at York Explore.
