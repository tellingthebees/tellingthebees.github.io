Part of the Being Human Festival 2017.

Another chance to see the Telling the Bees Performance-Lecture, last performed in the centre of Sheffield as part of The Festival of the Mind 2016.

The performance-lecture will take you through the past, present and future of bees and beekeeping. Together with Sheffield-based youth theatre company GrowTheatre, the performance will explore stories of the important and fascinating honey bee. This interactive performance will take you through four stations, combining drama and interactive tasks to help you explore different aspects of research on the bee. Youâ€™ll discover what a Beespoon is, how the honey bee got her sting, and get a glimpse into possible futures for our bees.
