If you've heard of hackathons and Raspberry Pi Jams, you'll be all over this. If not, come anyway: you'll love it. Just bring your imagination and our techies, coders, digital makers and artists will help you sprinkle a measure of arts into a dash of digital making to create a unique bee-related concoction in just one day.
