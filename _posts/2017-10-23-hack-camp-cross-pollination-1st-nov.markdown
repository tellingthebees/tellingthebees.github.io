Inventive young digital explorers let their imaginations run riot, blending tech with a bid to save the bees, at this one-day family event in November 2017. Members of the ongoing Muse Hack project showed off their skills to parents, while novices got their hands on arduinos, breadboards, coding, CAD software, the 3D printer, music sampling and other digital and traditional arts and craft resources. Techies, coders, digital makers and artists, under the guidance of Digital media artists Dave Young and Paul Fothergill from Interact and Connect, guided the groups to play, experiment and create a garden of the future, focusing on the conservation of bees. Approximately 20 children and their parents took part in the event. 

The Muse Hack project is recognised by York UNESCO city of media arts Digital Adventurers scheme to encourage and support children and young people in their creative and cultural pursuits and future careers in the sector.
