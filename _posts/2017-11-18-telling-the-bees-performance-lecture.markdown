The ‘Telling the Bees’ performance-lecture was originally created for the University of Sheffield's Festival of the Mind in 2016, where it was performed in a spiegaltent in the centre of the city. The event was reprised at the King's Manor in York for the Being Human Festival of the Humanities in 2017.

Working with Growtheatre's youth theatre company, professional actors and local beekeepers, the performance explored the past, present and future of bees and beekeeping.

The audience took part in an interactive performance where they were taken to four stations, combining drama and interactive tasks to help them explore different aspects of research on the bee. They discovered what a Beespoon is, how the honey bee got her sting, and had a glimpse into possible futures for our bees. Feedback was very positive at both events and many people lingered on to learn and share more stories about bees.
