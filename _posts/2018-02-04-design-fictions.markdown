[We worked with Manor Lodge and Wybourn Community Primary Schools](/activities/2017/11/15/sheffield-schools-visit-york.html) to produce a set of 3D-printed design fictions. These were objects or services that might exist in a future world where the bee population has plummeted or bees have become completely extinct.

Design ideas included the ‘Bee Buster,’ a spray to protect bee hives from predators such as hornets, a ‘Bee Dome,’ which is a sanctuary for bees that includes an antidote shower and a hospital for bees, and the ‘Bee Shield,’ which will provide the bees with protection.

We also developed an interactive exhibition wooden display cabinet to house the children's 3D-printed design fictions. The case includes an NFC reader and screen to intuitively play short videos associated with each 3D printed object.
