Any plans for the summer? Why not take part in this year’s Summer Reading Challenge? It’s simple. All you have to do is read any six books of your choosing, from ‘Harry Potter’ to ‘Great Expectations.’ Once you’ve completed a book, you’ll get a prize! But the clever folk who manage to read all six books before the summer is over will receive a medal and a certificate to celebrate their fantastic achievement! And guess what? It’s completely free. Just go to your nearest library and sign up today. 

This year, the theme is ‘Animal Agents,’ and York Explore library are hosting a large range of workshops for all you budding detectives out there. If you are an aspiring Snakelock Holmes, or more of a Dr Woofson, then come along to these workshops. Events include informative talks about your favourite animals, a bag decorating session to carry your books, a chance to crack some head-scratching animal puzzles and the rare opportunity to see different kinds of exotic animals. 

On the 14th and 15th of August, ‘Telling the Bees,’ will also be taking part in the ‘Summer Reading Challenge,’ by hosting our own workshop about the unique detective skills of the honey bee. We’ll introduce you to the wondrous world of bees through arts, crafts and storytelling. The session is free, but places are limited, so book soon if you don’t want to miss out.
