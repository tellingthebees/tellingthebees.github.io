Telling the Bees is an interdisciplinary arts and humanities research project (Feb 2017 - Jan 2018) between Universities of York, Sheffield and Lancaster, working with GrowTheatre (Sheffield) and Explore York Libraries & Archives. Telling the Bees aims to develop and promote understanding and new ways of thinking about bees and beekeeping through design, drama, and digital making. It builds on the outputs of a previous project that worked with beekeepers, storytelling and designers in Scotland.
