## About Telling the Bees 2
The second Telling the Bees project was an AHRC connected communities follow on project (Feb 2017 - Sept 2018) that built on outputs from Telling the Bees 1. We engaged with new audiences, bringing drama, design, storytelling and the maker (or hacker) movement together to explore playful, immersive ways to understand global environmental issues and share future visions about bees and beekeeping. The project was a collaboration between the universities of [York](http://www.york.ac.uk/tfti "University of York"), [Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/archaeology "University of Sheffield") and [Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/ "Lancaster University"), and [GrowTheatre](http://www.growtheatre.org.uk/ "Growtheatre") and [York Explore](https://www.exploreyork.org.uk/ "York Explore").


### Project Aims
Our project aims were:
1. To reconsider the concept of ‘future folklore’ about bees and beekeeping as embodied creative learning experiences by engaging with pupils in inner-city primary schools. _We consider 'future folklore' as ways to share knowledge through stories with an intention of casting forward, this might include films, artefacts, written stories, or performances)._
2. To experiment with creative ways to secure a sustainable legacy for co-produced project outputs. _For instance, we are exploring avenues for commercialising our Beespoon from the first Telling the Bees project._
3. To share and gather knowledge and stories across communities about the global significance and challenges facing pollinators and the honey bee.

### Project Strands
1. **Designing Fictions**  
We worked with Year 5 pupils from Manor Lodge and Wybourn Community Primary Schools in Sheffield to design imaginative Future Folklore prototypes that would either help save bees from extinction or replace them when they're gone.

2. **Repackaging the Beespoon**  
Our amazing [Beespoon](http://www.tellingthebees.buzz/beespoon/) interactive exhibit was rebuilt anew in a much portable and durable format. We now send it 'on tour' to local beekeeping associations and education providers for use at their engagement events.

3. **Widening Public Engagement**  
We attended a number of high profile events and festivals throughout the year. In collaboration with Explore York Libraries and Archives, we also hosted a series of bee-themed workshops, events and exhibitions.
