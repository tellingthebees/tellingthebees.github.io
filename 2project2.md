## Telling the Bees 2
The second Telling the Bees project (also called Hacking the Bees) was an AHRC connected communities follow on project (Feb 2017 - Sept 2018) that built on outputs from Telling the Bees 1. We engaged with new audiences, bringing drama, design, storytelling and the maker (or hacker) movement together to explore playful, immersive ways to understand global environmental issues and share future visions about bees and beekeeping. The project was a collaboration between the universities of [York](http://www.york.ac.uk/tfti "University of York"), [Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/archaeology "University of Sheffield") and [Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/ "Lancaster University"), and [GrowTheatre](http://www.growtheatre.org.uk/ "Growtheatre") and [York Explore](https://www.exploreyork.org.uk/ "York Explore").


### Project Strands
1. **Designing Fictions**  
We worked with Year 5 pupils from [Manor Lodge and Wybourn Community Primary Schools](https://www.tellingthebees.buzz/activities/2017/08/09/primary-school-visits.html) in Sheffield to design imaginative [design fictions](https://www.tellingthebees.buzz/artefacts/2018/02/04/design-fictions.html) that would either help save bees from extinction or replace them when they're gone.

2. **Repackaging the Beespoon**  
Our amazing [Beespoon](http://www.tellingthebees.buzz/beespoon/) interactive exhibit was rebuilt anew in a much portable and durable format. We now send it 'on tour' to local beekeeping associations and education providers for use at their engagement events.

3. **Widening Public Engagement**  
We attended a number of high profile events and festivals throughout the course of the project, including:
* BBC Countryfile Live at Blenheim Palace
* The Royal Highland Show
* Edinburgh International Science Festival
* The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
* Manchester Science Festival
* Glow Festival
* Carnival of the Beasties, Aberdeen
* Bee:Late at the Museum of Science and Industry
* RHS Chatsworth
* British Beekeepers' Association Spring Convention
* Rhubarb and Apple Weekends at Clumber Park
* Bee Green Festival at Lancaster University
* Ecclesall Woods Spring Festival, Sheffield
* AHRC Common Ground, York

In collaboration with Explore York Libraries and Archives, we also hosted a series of bee-themed [workshops](https://www.tellingthebees.buzz/activities/2017/09/05/summer-reading-challenge-bee-detectives.html), [events](https://www.tellingthebees.buzz/activities/2017/10/23/hack-camp-cross-pollination-1st-nov.html) and [exhibitions](https://www.tellingthebees.buzz/artefacts/2017/10/23/pollination-art-installation.html).
